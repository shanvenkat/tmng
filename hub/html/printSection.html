    <h2 class="text-center">Declaration</h2>
    <p>The signatory believes that: if the applicant is filing the application under 15 U.S.C. Section 1051(a), the applicant is the owner of the trademark/service mark sought to be registered; the applicant or the applicant's related company or licensee is using the mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods/services in the application, and such use by the applicant's related company or licensee inures to the benefit of the applicant; the specimen(s) shows the mark as used on or in connection with the goods/services in the application; and/or if the applicant filed an application under 15 U.S.C. Section 1051(b), Section 1126(d), and/or Section 1126(e), the applicant is entitled to use the mark in commerce; the applicant has a bona fide intention to use or use through the applicant's related company or licensee the mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods/services in the application. The signatory believes that to the best of the signatory's knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services of such other person, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive. The signatory being warned that willful false statements and the like are punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001, and that such willful false statements and the like may jeopardize the validity of the application or any registration resulting therefrom, declares that all statements made of his/her own knowledge are true and all statements made on information and belief are believed to be true.</p>

        <strong>NOTE TO APPLICANT:</strong> When filed as part of the electronic form (i.e., scanned and attached as an image file), the signature page must include both the signature information and the boilerplate declaration language. Do not include the entire application, but do ensure that the boilerplate declaration language actually appears; a signature by itself will not be acceptable. If, due to browser limitations, the boilerplate declaration language appears on a previous page when printed, you must "merge" the declaration and signature block onto a single page prior to signing, so that the one complete page can be scanned to create an acceptable image file. It is recommended that you copy-and-paste the entire text form into another document, manipulate the spacing there to move the declaration and signature section to a separate page, and then print this new version of the text form to send to the signatory.</p>
