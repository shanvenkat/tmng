The signatory believes that to the best of the signatory's knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use the mark in commerce, either in theTrademark/Service Mark Application, Principal Register http://tm-teas-fqt.etc.uspto.gov/...0121112815536499-eTEAS-53082f495191ac77a4752659f9eff43ff7546199843bc6b3e664e5ac6cabf512be[1/21/2015 11:42:20 AM] identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services of such other person, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive.

        NOTE TO APPLICANT: When filed as part of the electronic form (i.e., scanned and attached as an image file), the signature page must include both the signature information and the boilerplate declaration language. Do not include the entire application, but do ensure that the boilerplate declaration language actually appears; a signature by itself will not be acceptable. If, due to browser limitations, the boilerplate declaration language appears on a previous page when printed, you must "merge" the declaration and signature block onto a single page prior to signing, so that the one complete page can be scanned to create an acceptable image file. It is recommended that you copy-and-paste the entire text form into another document, manipulate the spacing there to move the declaration and signature section to a separate page, and then print this new version of the text form to send to the signatory.</p>
